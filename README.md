# Guide to Creating a Calendar in React


  This repository is used to learn how to create a calendar in react so that i can use it for an application I am working on. First i created an application using vite take vs code run the command

    npm create vite@latest

and then they will ask to specify the project name, what framework to use, which language to work on with and i chose calendar-component, react and javascript respectively. then u will get the project made for you in the downloads sections and then open the folder in vs code. In the terminal run the command

    npm install

this will install the necessary functions to run the code then u can run the command as given below and see that the application will be hosted on your localhost

    npm run dev

Now for this application we need a bunch of dependencies the ones that i have currently installed are listed below. First u need to go to the website material ui and from there choose core libraries and then u can choose material ui from there go to get started from where u can fetch all these commands and even code. To install material UI run the command 

    npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

after that we need to install another dependency for the calendar to be created those are

    npm install @mui/x-date-pickers

Install date library (if not already installed)
    
    npm install date-fns

then we can work on the calendar part there is a landscape calendar orientation in the mui page and there is code for that given there by some sort i can't get the code that i need there is dayjs there and not date-fns. so i will paste the code here just in case needed
